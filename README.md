## Install and Deploy NextMerce

In this part of the documentation we will show you how to install NextMerce.

<Callout type="info">
  Before moving forward, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
  Otherwise the installation commands will not work.
</Callout>

**1.** Download template and extract it. Then CD into that directory and run this command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# or
yarn install
```
    
> Some included packages causes peer-deps issue with React 19 while installing.
> With npm the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is a workaround for that at the moment.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```
